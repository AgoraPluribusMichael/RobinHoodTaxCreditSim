# Robin Hood Tax Credit Simulation

A simulation I did for my Robin Hood Tax Credit policy proposal. See more here:

Everything is in the Python file, with links to the sources in comments. I'm of the belief that all code is self-documenting... although I should probably come back at some point to make it more readable.

This is just a rough back-of-the-napkin simulation to show a ballpark for how much tax relief each worker can get. The simulation uses quarterly data, which is not the same as the proposed use case, which is monthly.
