# Robin Hood Tax Credit Simulation

A simulation I did for my Robin Hood Tax Credit policy proposal. See more here:

Everything is in the Python file, with links to the sources in comments. I'm of the belief that all code is self-documenting... although I should probably come back at some point to make it more readable.

This is just a rough back-of-the-napkin simulation to show a ballpark for how much tax relief each worker can get. The simulation uses aggregate quarterly data, which is not the same as the proposed use case, which is individualized and bimonthly. For example, even if, on the whole, the top 1% lost wealth over a quarter, it's possible for a few of them to have gotten richer, in which case, those who got richer would still have a wealth gains tax liability under the current proposal.
